# Sensible World of Starsector

A collection of QoL improvements to campaign layer of Starsector.
Safe to install and uninstall mid-game.
Also changes some vanilla settings:

-   `altMouseMoveToMassTransfer` (true instead of false),
-   `campaignSpeedupMult` (4 instead of 2),
-   `enableShipExplosionWhiteout` (false instead of true),
-   `enableUIStaticNoise` (false instead of true), and
-   `uiFadeSpeedMult` (10000 instead of 1, disable UI fade animation).

## TranspOFFder

Automatically turn off your transponder whenever you transition to Hyperspace.

## Better Active Sensor Burst

Do not disable Sustained Burn when using Active Sensor Burst.
Fleet will move slowly for the cooldown duration (instead of doing full stop).

## Scavenge as You Fly

Use Scavenge ability as soon as it is usable.

## Partial Survey as You Fly

No need to "touch" the planet any more.
Automatically provide partial survey for planets within your sensor range.
