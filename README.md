# Transponder Off

A collection of QoL improvements to campaign layer of Starsector.
Named after first QoL addition - Transponder Off, or just `transpoffder`.
Safe to install and uninstall mid-game.

Comes in two flavours: basic mod (`transpoffder-x.y.z.zip`) and mod that changes some settings (see below, `transpoffder-x.y.z-with-settings.zip`).

## Transponder Off in Hyperspace

Automatically turn off fleet transponder when transitioning to Hyperspace.

## Better Active Sensor Burst

Do not disable Sustained Burn or Neutrino Detector when using Active Sensor Burst.
Fleet will move slowly for the cool-down duration (instead of doing full stop) and resume full burn afterwards.

## Scavenge as You Fly

Use Scavenge ability as soon as it is usable.
Toggled via new ability (blue Scavenge icon).

## Partial Survey as You Fly

No need to "touch" the planet any more.
Automatically provide partial survey for planets within your sensor range.

## Vanilla Settings Changed
