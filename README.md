# Transponder Off

A collection of QoL improvements to campaign layer of Starsector.
Named after first QoL addition - Transponder Off, or just `transpoffder`.
Safe to install and uninstall mid-game.
Also changes some vanilla settings.

## Transponder Off in Hyperspace

Automatically turn off fleet transponder whenever transitioning to Hyperspace.

## Better Active Sensor Burst

Do not disable Sustained Burn or Neutrino Detector when using Active Sensor Burst.
Fleet will move slowly for the cool-down duration (instead of doing full stop).

## Scavenge as You Fly

Use Scavenge ability as soon as it is usable.

## Partial Survey as You Fly

No need to "touch" the planet any more.
Automatically provide partial survey for planets within your sensor range.

## Vanilla Settings Changed

-   `altMouseMoveToMassTransfer` (true instead of false),
-   `campaignSpeedupMult` (3 instead of 2),
-   `enableShipExplosionWhiteout` (false instead of true),
-   `enableUIStaticNoise` (false instead of true), and
-   `uiFadeSpeedMult` (10000 instead of 1, disable UI fade animation).
